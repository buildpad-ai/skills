**Establish the tenancy mode.** An Engine project's application separates its customers in one of
two modes: `scope`, where customers share the project's one tenant and are separated by scope
nodes (the default), or `customer-tenants`, where each customer is a tenant of its own, copied from
the project's tenant (the Blueprint). Before you act on anything that differs between the two, find
the mode with these steps, in order, and stop at the first step that answers:

1. Read `.buildpad/project.json` at the project root. If it is JSON and its field `tenancy` is
   `"scope"` or `"customer-tenants"`, that is the mode. If `.buildpad/tenancy-answer.json` names
   the other mode, tell the developer the two files disagree and follow `.buildpad/project.json`:
   when Customer_Tenants were turned on or off after the starter kit was downloaded, the developer
   sets `tenancy` in `.buildpad/project.json` or downloads the kit again.
2. Otherwise read `.buildpad/tenancy-answer.json` in the same way; if its `tenancy` is `"scope"`
   or `"customer-tenants"`, that is the mode.
3. Otherwise, if the request is for customers that each have their own data, people or
   administrators, ask the developer once: "Does each customer of this application have a tenant
   of its own on the Engine (Customer_Tenants, turned on for the project on the Buildpad
   platform), or do all customers share the project's one tenant, separated by scopes?" Write the
   answer to `.buildpad/tenancy-answer.json` as
   `{"buildpadTenancyAnswer": 1, "tenancy": "customer-tenants"}` or
   `{"buildpadTenancyAnswer": 1, "tenancy": "scope"}`, and ask the developer to commit that file.
   Do not add it to `.gitignore`. Never write `.buildpad/project.json`.
4. Otherwise the mode is `scope`.

To find the mode, do not open an environment file (`.env`, `.env.*`) or an MCP configuration file,
do not call a tool that returns project credentials, and do not call `GET /api/tenants`. In the
mode `scope` the rest of the skills hold as written. In the mode `customer-tenants` follow the
guide `engine-customer-tenants` of the `add-multitenancy` skill wherever it differs from them.
