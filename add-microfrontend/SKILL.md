# Add Micro-Frontend (Iframe Composition)

This skill owns the **composition mechanism**: the host component, the bridge
protocol, auth and URL and scope syncing, sandbox flags, and CSP.

[add-microapp](../add-microapp/SKILL.md) owns domain boundaries, collection ownership,
RBAC, and repo bootstrap. Load it first. Come back here to wire the apps together.

All apps share **one** DaaS backend and **one** Supabase project. Each micro-app is a
standalone Next.js app with its own SSR, routing, and deployment. The browser composes
them.

## When to use iframes

Use this skill when at least two of these are true:

- Separate teams own separate parts of the product.
- Parts must deploy on their own schedule.
- A part must not be able to read the host DOM, CSS, or memory.
- A part already exists as a deployed app.

Do not use this skill when:

- One team owns everything. Use routes in a single app.
- The parts share layout, modals, or a scroll container. See the limits in
  [url-and-history](references/url-and-history.instructions.md).
- You want code reuse. Iframes share nothing. Use a package.
- The section is a widget, not a page.

The cost is real. Iframe composition adds an auth bridge, a message contract, echo
suppression, history rules, dialog limits, and two CSP headers. Isolation is complete;
complexity is not low. `add-microapp` without iframes is often the better answer.

## Critical Rules

1. Micro-apps load in `<iframe>` elements. The Main App owns layout, navigation, and
   the frame `src`.
2. The Main App must not read the frame DOM. The micro-app must not read
   `window.parent` DOM. All communication uses `postMessage`.
3. Copy `assets/shared/bridge-protocol.ts` and `assets/shared/mfe-cookies.ts` to every
   app. Do not retype message shapes or cookie names.
4. Every message handler must check `event.origin`, then `event.source`, then the
   `source` and `v` envelope fields.
5. The iframe `src` must depend on the micro-app origin and the route path only. It
   must never depend on the host query string.
6. The Main App owns token refresh. `SET_AUTH` carries `access_token` and `expires_at`.
   It must never carry `refresh_token`. When the host session is inside the renewal
   window, the host must call `refreshSession()` before answering — `getSession()`
   alone returns the same token and the frame asks again forever.
7. Each micro-app stores its own access token in its own cookie, on its own origin,
   with `SameSite=None; Secure; Partitioned`. The bridge is required on Amplify, on a
   custom domain, and in local development.
8. A micro-app validates the bridge token with `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` on every
   request (via `getMfeUser` in `lib/bridge/mfe-middleware.ts`). Never trust a local
   decode: only `getUser` observes a sign-out that happened in the Main App.
9. **Never overwrite a CLI-owned file.** Any file carrying an `@buildpad-origin`
   header belongs to the Buildpad CLI. It is restored by `npx buildpad upgrade` **and
   by any `buildpad add <library>`** — both rewrite owned files with no prompt, which
   is why every module install happens in Step 4a, before any merge. One documented
   exception: `components/layout/navigation.ts` carries the header but its own docblock
   says to edit it freely.
   The bridge merges into these files with the pinned edits in
   [auth-bridge](references/auth-bridge.instructions.md); it never replaces them.
   See "CLI-owned files" below.
10. The host sign-out control must `await logoutAllMicroapps()` before it triggers
    `/api/auth/logout`. The host cannot delete a cookie on a micro-app origin.
11. `SET_AUTH` must carry `resource_uri` on any project that uses `manage-scope` or
    `add-multitenancy`. Without it every micro-app call resolves at root scope and
    returns 403. On a project that uses neither, no scope cookie exists and no
    `X-Resource-Uri` header is expected — do not fabricate one.
12. Two token paths exist, and a module uses one of them. The CLI's ~16 Next proxy
    routes read `lib/api/auth-headers.ts` — pinned edit H1 covers those. A module whose
    hooks import `lib/buildpad/services/api-request.ts` calls DaaS **directly** from the
    browser and never touches H1 — pinned edit W1 is the only thing that authenticates
    it. Run
    `grep -rl "services/api-request" components lib` and
    `grep -rn "fetch('/api/" components lib` in the installed module, then apply both
    edits. The Users module is direct-call: H1 can be perfect while every users, roles,
    policies, and permissions call fails.
13. The sandbox attribute must omit `allow-modals` and `allow-top-navigation`. It must
    include `allow-popups`, `allow-downloads`, and
    `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation`. `allow-popups` is load-bearing for the
    Files module download, not only for OAuth — see
    [security](references/security.instructions.md).
14. Micro-app pages must not call `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or
    `window.prompt` — including calls shipped by the CLI (audit for them in Step 4).
    Use Mantine `Modal` or `modals.openConfirmModal`.
15. A framed micro-app renders **content only**. The host owns all chrome, so the
    frame must show no sidebar, no header, no login form, and no sign-out control —
    double chrome also lets the user navigate the frame away from the section the
    host thinks is open. Pinned edit E1 skips `AuthenticatedShell` when the request
    arrives inside a frame; opened directly, the micro-app keeps its full shell. E1
    must decide from the bridge cookie, not from `Sec-Fetch-Dest` alone: an RSC fetch
    and `router.refresh()` re-render the same layout on the server with
    `Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty`, and a header-only test then mounts a second full shell.
16. All apps must use the same `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDPAD_DAAS_URL`,
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
17. `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_ORIGIN` / `HOST_ORIGIN` are **reserved by the CLI's
    `lib/origin.ts`** and mean *this app's own* public origin. Never set them to
    another app's URL. The Main App's origin travels in
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_MICROAPP_URL_MAIN`, which bootstrap already writes into every
    `.env.local`. Localhost overrides go in `.env.development.local`, never
    `.env.local` — `next build` loads `.env.local`, so a localhost value there is
    baked into the production CSP.
18. Verify field names with `mcp_daas_schema` or `mcp_daas_fields` before you write any
    `sort`, `fields`, or `filter` parameter. A wrong name returns a 500 that is hard to
    trace through the frame.

## CLI-owned files

A Buildpad starter is not an empty Next.js app. `npx @buildpad/cli bootstrap` installs
components, auth routes, and middleware, and marks each file with an
`@buildpad-origin` header. `npx buildpad upgrade` restores them — interactively it
prompts on local changes, but with `--yes` or `--strategy=overwrite` (what a
non-interactive agent uses) it **silently reverts them**.

Before Step 3, run the preflight in every app:

```bash
grep -rl "@buildpad-origin" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" app components lib middleware.ts 2>/dev/null
```

Files this skill touches, and how:

| Path | Owner | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` | CLI | **Merge** — pinned edits M1–M3 in [auth-bridge](references/auth-bridge.instructions.md) |
| `middleware.ts` (root) | CLI | **Do not touch** — it sets `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, the only cache header on ~20 session routes |
| `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` | CLI | **Merge** — pinned edit L1 (expire the three bridge cookies with `framedCookieOptions(0, …)`, never `delete()`). It has a GET handler the shell navigates to; never drop it |
| `app/login/page.tsx` | CLI | **Merge** — pinned edit P1 (wrap the form in `LoginBridge`) |
| `components/DaaSProviderWrapper.tsx` | CLI | **Merge** — pinned edit W1 (`useMfeToken` as second token source **and** the readiness gate) |
| `components/ui/file-manager/*`, `components/ui/users-management/*`, module hooks | CLI | **Do not touch** — installed by `buildpad add files-routes` / `add users-routes`. Wrap them; never edit them. This is why `search` cannot be URL-synced (Step 4) |
| `components/layout/AuthenticatedShell.tsx` | CLI | **Merge** (host only) — pinned edit S1 (`await logoutAllMicroapps()`). Micro-apps leave it untouched: E1 keeps it out of the frame entirely |
| `app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` | CLI | **Merge** (micro-app) — pinned edit E1 (skip the shell when framed; content only inside the frame) |
| `lib/api/auth-headers.ts` | CLI | **Merge** — pinned edit H1 (read `mfe_access_token` before the session) |
| everything under `lib/bridge/`, `components/Microapp*`, `components/LoginBridge.tsx`, `config/app-urls.ts`, `next.config.ts`, the three bridge auth routes | this skill | **New files** — copy from `assets/` |

On every merged file, add one line under the CLI header:
`// ⚠️ LOCAL MODIFICATION (add-microfrontend): re-apply pinned edits after buildpad upgrade`.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Discover the project context (always first)

Call `get_project_detail` on the platform MCP server. Take every URL and credential
from the response. Never ask the user for them.

Tool naming in this repo: platform tools have no prefix (`get_project_detail`). DaaS
tools use the `mcp_daas_*` prefix (`mcp_daas_schema`, `mcp_daas_cors-settings`).

Read `project.mainAmplifyUrl` (host origin), `project.daasUrl`,
`project.supabaseUrl`, `project.supabaseAnonKey`, and `microapps[]` (each with `name`
and `amplifyUrl`). The response may carry more fields than the documented schema
(`workers`, `messaging`, …) — the schema lists what these skills consume, not
everything the platform returns. When you enumerate origins (CSP, CORS), enumerate
what is actually present.

Stop and report to the user if `daasUrl`, `supabaseUrl`, or `mainAmplifyUrl` is null.
Do not continue with a placeholder.

Full response schema:
[add-microapp context discovery](../add-microapp/references/context-discovery.instructions.md).

### Step 1: Write `config/app-urls.ts` in every app

This file is committed to git. Amplify builds it with no console configuration.
The local-dev override for the Main App origin is `NEXT_PUBLIC_MICROAPP_URL_MAIN` —
bootstrap already writes the deployed value into every `.env.local` (Rule 17; never
`NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_ORIGIN`). Put localhost overrides in `.env.development.local`
only: `next build` loads `.env.local`, and a localhost value there ends up inside
the production CSP header.

Generation rules and the failure modes:
[add-microapp app-urls config](../add-microapp/references/app-urls-config.instructions.md).

### Step 2: Install the bridge contract

Copy to `lib/bridge/` in the Main App **and** in every micro-app, unchanged:

| Copy from | Copy to |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/shared/bridge-protocol.ts` | `lib/bridge/bridge-protocol.ts` |
| `assets/shared/mfe-cookies.ts` | `lib/bridge/mfe-cookies.ts` |

### Step 3: Wire the host

New files (no collisions):

| Copy from | Copy to |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/host/useMicroappHost.ts` | `lib/bridge/useMicroappHost.ts` |
| `assets/host/MicroappIframe.tsx` | `components/MicroappIframe.tsx` |

Set the Main App login route in `useMicroappHost.ts` at the line marked `AGENT`.
Change nothing else.

**Route mapping.** `microapps[]` carries a `name` and an `amplifyUrl` — **no route**.
Four strings that look alike are independent; write the table before writing pages:

| Platform `name` | `MICROAPP_URLS` key | Local directory | Host page file | `path` prop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `users-management` | `'users-management'` | whatever the repo is called | `app/(authenticated)/users/page.tsx` | that micro-app's `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_ROUTE` |

The `path` prop must be a route that **exists in that micro-app** — read its
`DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_ROUTE` from its `config/app-urls.ts`, or verify a page file
exists at the path you choose. A wrong `path` does not error: it bounces through the
login bridge and looks like it works while every deep link is broken.

**Host pages** live in the authenticated route group — in a Buildpad starter that is
`app/(authenticated)/`, whose layout mounts `DaaSProviderWrapper` and the app shell.
A page outside it renders with no auth context and no chrome. The embedding page must
wrap the frame in `Suspense`: `useMicroappHost` reads `useSearchParams()`, and a
statically prerendered page without a boundary fails `next build`.

```tsx
// app/(authenticated)/users/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { Skeleton } from '@mantine/core';
import { MicroappIframe } from '@/components/MicroappIframe';
import { MICROAPP_URLS } from '@/config/app-urls';

export default function UsersSectionPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton height="100%" width="100%" />}>
      <MicroappIframe
        src={MICROAPP_URLS['users-management']}
        path="/users"
        title="Users Management"
        // Derive this list from what the framed page really syncs (Step 4), never
        // from a generic default. A name the micro-app never sends is dead weight;
        // a name the micro-app sends and this list omits is dropped silently.
        allowedParams={['user']}
        // Inside Mantine AppShell.Main, subtract the header AND the shell padding.
        height="calc(100vh - 60px - 2 * var(--mantine-spacing-lg))"
      />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

Navigation in a hand-written shell must be a client component
(`<NavLink component={Link} …>` inside `'use client'`). The starter's
`AuthenticatedShell` handles nav itself — add the section items to it instead.

**Sign-out (pinned edit S1).** The starter's shell signs out with
`window.location.href = '/api/auth/logout'` — a GET navigation, not a POST fetch.
There is nothing to intercept after it runs, so the broadcast must come first, awaited:

```tsx
// components/layout/AuthenticatedShell.tsx — the sign-out onClick (CLI-owned; merge)
onClick={async () => {
  const { logoutAllMicroapps } = await import('@/lib/bridge/useMicroappHost');
  await logoutAllMicroapps();               // broadcast LOGOUT + 300 ms drain
  window.location.href = '/api/auth/logout'; // the CLI GET route, unchanged
}}
```

Call `broadcastScope(uri)` after a tenant switch (scope projects only).

### Step 4: Wire each micro-app

#### 4a. Install the domain module FIRST (before any file below)

**Order is not optional.** `buildpad add <library>` rewrites files it owns without a
prompt and without `--overwrite`: an observed `buildpad add api-routes` reverted six
already-merged files (E1, L1, P1, W1, H1, and `api/auth/user`), and
`add users-routes` silently replaced a local page. Install every module you need
**before** applying any pinned edit, or the CLI destroys your merges.

A micro-app whose domain matches a Buildpad module must scaffold that module instead
of hand-writing a page:

| Domain | Skill | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| files | [add-files](../add-files/SKILL.md) | `npx @buildpad/cli@latest add files-routes` |
| users, roles, policies | [add-users](../add-users/SKILL.md) | `npx @buildpad/cli@latest add users-routes` |

A hand-written placeholder page is acceptable ONLY when no module covers the domain.

CLI 1.11.1 installs group-aware — it writes `app/(authenticated)/files/…` directly and
records those paths in `buildpad.json`. Verify where the routes landed; move them under
`app/(authenticated)/` only if the CLI did not, and never by hand-editing
`buildpad.json`. Run the module's own required proxy routes step only if those routes
are genuinely missing — bootstrap already installs a large `api-routes` set, and
re-running it is what reverts merges.

The cost of skipping the module is measured, not theoretical. A placeholder exercises
the bridge and nothing else. The module is what carries downloads, modals, permission
gates, and the CLI's own dialogs, and each behaves differently inside the frame: the
Files row-menu download runs through `window.open` to a signed cross-origin URL and
needs `allow-popups` as well as `allow-downloads`; a Mantine confirm dialog stops being
modal at the frame edge; the module mounts its data fetches before the bridge token
exists (W1b). Six field trials on placeholder pages passed every gate in this skill
while the real modules were broken.

#### 4b. New files (no collisions)

| Copy from | Copy to |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/microapp/MicroappBridgeProvider.tsx` | `components/MicroappBridgeProvider.tsx` |
| `assets/microapp/LoginBridge.tsx` | `components/LoginBridge.tsx` |
| `assets/microapp/useQueryParamSync.ts` | `hooks/useQueryParamSync.ts` |
| `assets/microapp/useMfeToken.ts` | `lib/bridge/useMfeToken.ts` |
| `assets/microapp/mfe-middleware.ts` | `lib/bridge/mfe-middleware.ts` |
| `assets/microapp/set-session.route.ts` | `app/api/auth/set-session/route.ts` |
| `assets/microapp/token.route.ts` | `app/api/auth/token/route.ts` |

#### 4c. Merges into CLI-owned files

Apply these only AFTER 4a. Exact hunks in
[auth-bridge](references/auth-bridge.instructions.md), "Pinned edits":

1. **M1–M3** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — accept the bridge token as a second
   session source and gate `/api/auth/token`. Do **not** replace the file: it owns the
   `publicOrigin()` redirect, the Supabase cookie refresh, and the route table.
2. **L1** `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` — expire the three bridge cookies inside
   `performLogout()`, before `signOut()`, using `framedCookieOptions(0, …)` — a bare
   `delete()` emits an unpartitioned Lax expiry that the cross-site frame rejects.
   Keep the GET handler and the OAuth SLO.
3. **P1** `app/login/page.tsx` — wrap the CLI form in `LoginBridge` (with `Suspense`).
4. **W1** `components/DaaSProviderWrapper.tsx` — add `useMfeToken()` as the framed
   token source alongside the Supabase path, **and gate the children on its `ready`
   flag**. Both halves are required. Without the gate the module mounts and fires its
   first DaaS fetches with no `Authorization` header, gets 401, and never retries —
   Users shows "Not authenticated" forever and Files shows an empty file list over a
   backend that holds files.
5. **H1** `lib/api/auth-headers.ts` — read `mfe_access_token` first, fall back to the
   Supabase session (this single edit fixes all ~16 CLI proxy routes). H1 covers the
   Next proxy routes only. A direct-call module needs W1 (Rule 12).
6. **E1** `app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` — render content only when framed
   (Rule 15's implementation path): skip `AuthenticatedShell`, keep
   `DaaSProviderWrapper`. Standalone keeps the full shell. Decide from the bridge
   cookie; `Sec-Fetch-Dest` alone fails on every RSC re-render. Without this, the frame
   shows a second sidebar, header, and profile menu inside the host's — and its nav
   lets the user move the frame to a different page than the host section.

#### 4d. Then wire

- Mount `MicroappBridgeProvider` in the micro-app **root** layout, inside
  `MantineProvider`. A page that is not wrapped never reports that it loaded, and the
  host shows its error state.
- Add `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_ROUTE` to `config/app-urls.ts` — the micro-app's first
  real route.
- **Wire the URL sync.** From buildpad-ui's URL-state release
  ([PR #154](https://github.com/buildpad-ai/ui/pull/154)), the list managers
  persist search/filter/sort/page (and Files' `folder`) in the frame's URL by
  default via `history.replaceState`, and `MicroappBridgeProvider`'s
  `OutboundUrlMirror` posts those writes to the host automatically — **module
  search now syncs with zero per-module wiring**. Two obligations remain:

  1. Reconcile the host allowlist. `pickParams()` filters both directions, so
     every parameter the module writes must be named in the host page's
     `allowedParams` or it is dropped silently:
     `['search', 'role', 'status', 'sort', 'page', 'folder', 'user', 'file']`
     covers the stock modules plus the row-click sync below.
  2. Detail-record sync stays a wrapper concern: drive `user`/`file` from
     `onUserClick`/`onFileClick` in a **new local file** rendered by the CLI
     page (the CLI page itself is `@buildpad-origin` — a one-line merge).

  On module versions **before** the URL-state release, module search is
  unsyncable — those managers hold `search`/`page`/`sort` in private
  `useState` inside `@buildpad-origin` files with no controlled prop, and
  Rule 9 forbids editing them. Do not scrape the frame DOM to fake it; take
  the upstream update instead.
- **Audit for native dialogs**:
  `grep -rn 'window\.\(confirm\|alert\|prompt\)' app components lib --include='*.tsx'`.
  The CLI's `rich-text-markdown.tsx` ships a `window.prompt` that is silently dead in
  the frame — replace the call or avoid that interface on framed pages (Rule 14).

### Step 5: Create the CSP headers

**A Buildpad starter ships no `next.config.ts` — create it.** These are complete
files. Two traps: the snippet must be a whole module (not a bare `headers()` method),
and `@/…` aliases do not resolve from the Next config loader — the import must be
**relative**. Never bake `localhost` into a production header: gate local origins on
`NODE_ENV`.

```ts
// Main App: next.config.ts (new file)
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';
import { MICROAPP_URLS } from './config/app-urls';

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
const microappOrigins = Object.values(MICROAPP_URLS).map((u) => new URL(u).origin);
const frameSrc = ["'self'", ...microappOrigins, ...(dev ? ['http://localhost:3001', 'http://localhost:3002'] : [])];

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [{
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [{
        key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
        // frame-ancestors 'none': the host holds the real Supabase session and
        // must not be framable by anyone. frame-src limits what IT may embed —
        // it does nothing to stop it being embedded.
        value: `frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src ${frameSrc.join(' ')}`,
      }],
    }];
  },
};
export default nextConfig;
```

```ts
// Micro-app: next.config.ts (new file)
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';
import { HOST_ORIGIN } from './config/app-urls';

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
const ancestors = ["'self'", HOST_ORIGIN, ...(dev ? ['http://localhost:3000'] : [])];

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [{
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [{ key: 'Content-Security-Policy', value: `frame-ancestors ${ancestors.join(' ')}` }],
    }];
  },
};
export default nextConfig;
```

Verify after `pnpm build`: the resolved origins — and no `http://localhost` — appear in
`jq '.headers' .next/routes-manifest.json`.

### Step 6: Configure CORS (runnable)

The DaaS default (`cors_origins: ["*"]`, `cors_allow_credentials: false`) blocks
**every** credentialed browser call: the Fetch spec discards a credentialed response
carrying `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Fix it with the DaaS MCP tool
`mcp_daas_cors-settings` (wired in `.mcp.json`; REST equivalent
`PATCH /api/settings/cors`):

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "cors_origins": ["<mainAmplifyUrl>", "<each microapps[].amplifyUrl>", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001", "http://localhost:3002"],
  "cors_allow_credentials": true,
  "cors_allowed_headers": ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "Origin", "X-Requested-With", "Accept", "X-Resource-Uri"],
  "cors_max_age": 0
}
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -si -X OPTIONS "<daasUrl>/api/items/anything" -H "Origin: <mainAmplifyUrl>" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" | grep -i access-control
```

The response must echo the origin (not `*`) and include
`access-control-allow-credentials: true`.

### Step 7: Add the tests

The starters ship no test tooling. Install it, then copy the three assets:

```bash
pnpm add -D @playwright/test
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

| `assets/tests/playwright.config.ts` | `playwright.config.ts` |
| `assets/tests/auth.setup.ts` | `tests/auth.setup.ts` |
| `assets/tests/iframe-composition.spec.ts` | `tests/iframe-composition.spec.ts` |

Fill every value in the spec's `AGENT` block and the config's `webServer` array (one
entry per app — this composition needs three servers). Add `playwright/.auth/` and
`test-results/` to `.gitignore`. Run with real credentials:

```bash
TEST_EMAIL=... TEST_PASSWORD=... pnpm exec playwright test
```

**Never add a host route to `publicRoutes` to make a test pass** — `auth.setup.ts` +
`storageState` is the correct fix for tests landing on `/login`.

### Step 8: Deploy (gated)

`pnpm build` must pass **in every app you touched** before any push — Amplify runs the
same build, and a failure surfaces minutes later in a file unrelated to your change.
Then push each micro-app first, then the Main App. No console environment variable
changes are needed: the URLs live in `config/app-urls.ts`.

After the first deploy, verify the handshake **on the deployed origins**, not on
localhost — two localhost ports are the same *site*, so partitioned-cookie failures
(Safari, Incognito) are invisible locally.

## Before You Call It Done

Each item names its procedure — a box without evidence is not ticked.

- [ ] Every micro-app whose domain matches a Buildpad module renders that module, not a
      hand-written placeholder (Step 4, first bullet). A placeholder proves the bridge
      and nothing about the module.
- [ ] The frame shows real data. Record every DaaS response inside the frame and assert
      that **none** is 401 or 403. An empty list is not proof of an empty backend: the
      Files module swallows a 401 and renders "Drag files here" while files exist.
- [ ] The parameter the framed page syncs appears in the host `allowedParams`, and
      driving it in the frame updates the host URL while the frame `src` is unchanged
      (spec: *in-frame state reaches the host URL*). When the installed module exposes
      no controllable state, the gap is recorded and this box is marked N/A.
- [ ] A signed-in user reaches a micro-app section with no login form and no extra
      click (spec: *auth bridge signs the frame in*).
- [ ] Inside the frame the micro-app shows **no** sidebar, header, or profile menu;
      opened directly on its own origin it still shows the full shell (E1). Check this
      after a **fresh** host page load and after a host tenant switch, not only after a
      client-side navigation — an RSC re-render is what defeats a header-only E1.
- [ ] Renewal works without waiting an hour: overwrite `mfe_expires_at` to now+70 s
      and observe a second `set-session` round trip (spec: *token renewal*).
- [ ] Sign-out: `mfe_access_token` is present on the frame origin **before** the
      click and absent after (spec: *logout clears the micro-app cookie*).
- [ ] Scope projects only (Rule 11): a frame's `/api/items/*` call carries
      `X-Resource-Uri`. On other projects this box does not apply.
- [ ] `jq '.headers' .next/routes-manifest.json` shows the CSP with real origins and
      no `http://localhost` in a production build, in every app.
- [ ] The Step 6 `curl` echoes the origin and `access-control-allow-credentials: true`.
- [ ] `pnpm build` is green in every touched app.
- [ ] The deployed handshake was verified on the real cross-site origins, including
      once in Safari or an Incognito window (partitioned cookies).
